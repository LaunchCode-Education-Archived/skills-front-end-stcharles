                    <h1 id="studio-flicklist-0">Studio: FlickList 0</h1>
<p>Welcome to your first Studio! Today is mostly just about getting set up.</p>
<p>First, you will use Git to grab the starter code for the project.</p>
<p>Next, you will register for an API key with themoviedb.org, an open source database of movies.</p>
<p>Finally you'll plug your API key into the starter code, and see some immediate results!</p>
<h2 id="submit-individually">Submit Individually</h2>
<p>Today, it is best if you complete this studio on your own computer, rather than with a partner. You are still encouraged to work together with others, but each coder should have their own computer open.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-the-starter-code">Obtaining the Starter Code</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to get started:</p>
<h3 id="fork-the-flicklist-repo">Fork the FlickList Repo</h3>
<p>Once you have signed into github, head over to the repository where our class project is hosted: <a href="https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/flicklist"><a href="https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/flicklist">https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/flicklist</a></a>.</p>
<p>To work on this project, you'll need to <em>fork</em> your own version of it. Near the upper-right corner of the screen, you should see a button that says &quot;Fork&quot;. Click it!</p>
<p>You should now be taken to a new, nearly identical project page. But instead of <code>LaunchCodeEducation/flicklist</code>, this is <code>YOURUSERNAME/flicklist</code>.</p>
<h3 id="clone-your-fork">Clone your Fork</h3>
<p>Now that you have your own <em>remote</em> repository hosted on GitHub, it's time to start working on it. To do so, you will <em>clone</em> the remote repo onto your local machine.</p>
<p>Open up the terminal, and <code>cd</code> into the parent folder where you want this project to live. Then clone your repo:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/flicklist.git
Cloning into 'flicklist'...
remote: Counting objects: 103, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (49/49), done.
remote: Total 103 (delta 32), reused 102 (delta 31), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (103/103), 17.92 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (32/32), done.
Checking connectivity... done.</code></pre>
<p>You should now see a new folder.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ ls
flicklist</code></pre>
<p>Have a look inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ cd flicklist/
$ ls
README.md  css/  index.html  js/</code></pre>
<p>There's some code in here! Open up index.html and take a very brief look. Seems like a lot of stuff. In fact, the entire finished project is all here. See for yourself by opening up this page in a browser window.</p>
<p>Why did we give you the finished product? Well, this is a Git repo, so in fact, the entire history of the project is actually present. To start from the beginning, you just have to go back in time!</p>
<p>We have created 6 <em>branches</em> at various points in the history of the project, one for each Studio. You will complete each studio from a different one of these &quot;jumping off points&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="check-out-the-new-branch">Check Out the new Branch</h3>
<p>Watch what happens when you checkout the new branch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git checkout studio0
Branch studio0 set up to track remote branch studio0 from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'studio0'</code></pre>
<p>Git informs us that we have &quot;switched to&quot; the other branch. If you take another look at <code>index.html</code>, you should see a big change! You might also notice that the <code>css/</code> directory has disappeared entirely. And if you preview the webpage in the browser again, you will see that the fancy movie content has reverted to some very basic text.</p>
<p>We have officially time traveled into the past!</p>
<h2 id="starter-code">Starter Code</h2>
<p>In <code>index.html</code>, we have hardcoded some text to appear on the browser screen. At the bottom of the file, notice that we have left a small <code>TODO</code> for you, which is to finish our <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag so that it loads up our local <code>flicklist.js</code> file.</p>
<p>In <code>js/flicklist.js</code>, you will see a javascript object stored in a local variable called <code>api</code>.</p>
<p>Below that is a function called <code>testTheAPI()</code>, which, true to its name, tests our ability to connect to themoviedb's API. It does so by making making an AJAX request (using jQuery's <code>.ajax</code> function) to this url: &quot;<a href="https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie">https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie</a>&quot;, passing along your API key as a parameter. A success &quot;callback&quot; function is provided to the request, which will be invoked if a response comes back successfully. This callback function will log the response to the console.</p>
<p>After defining the function, we have a simple <code>console.log</code> statement, and then we invoke the function.</p>
<p>That was a mouthful. If any of these terms are unfamiliar to you, know that they are covered thoroughly in Module 8 of CS50, and will be reviewed in your Prep Work for next class.</p>
<p>For today, the only things you need to do are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get your API key from themoviedb.org (we'll do that next).</li>
<li>In <code>index.html</code>, Fill in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag so that it loads the <code>flicklist.js</code> Javascript file.</li>
<li>In <code>flicklist.js</code>, paste your key into the code as indicated by the <code>TODO</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="themoviedb-api">TheMovieDB API</h2>
<p>TheMovieDB is a freely available database of movies and TV shows. We will use their API as the source of our project's data. This API, like most, requires that you register and obtain a key in order to use it.</p>
<p>Here's how to nab that key:</p>
<h3 id="sign-up-for-an-account">Sign up for an Account</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup" target="_blank">Register here</a>. Then check your email and click the confirmation link.</p>
<h3 id="sign-up-for-api-key">Sign up for API Key</h3>
<p>Visit the following url:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/account/bobthebuilder/request-api?type=developer">https://www.themoviedb.org/account/bobthebuilder/request-api?type=developer</a></p>
<p>where &quot;bobthebuilder&quot; is your username for the account you just created. Click on the &quot;I agree&quot; button.</p>
<h3 id="register-your-project">Register Your Project</h3>
<p>You will now be presented with a form. TheMovieDB wants to know about the cool people like us who are using their service. Go ahead and fill the form out. For the project url, point them to your repo on github.</p>
<h3 id="get-the-key">Get the Key!</h3>
<p>You should now be taken to your profile page, where your key should be visible.</p>
<h2 id="your-task">Your Task</h2>
<p>Again, you have three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get your API key from themoviedb.org.</li>
<li>In <code>index.html</code>, Fill in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag so that it loads the <code>flicklist.js</code> Javascript file.</li>
<li>In <code>flicklist.js</code>, paste your key into the code as indicated by the <code>TODO</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have completed these steps, open up the page and see if it works!</p>
<h2 id="commit-and-push-on-git">Commit and Push on Git</h2>
<p>If you run the <code>git status</code> command, you should see that you now have <em>unstaged</em> changes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git status
On branch studio0
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   index.html
        modified:   js/flicklist.js

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</code></pre>
<p>We can stage these changes with the <code>add</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git add --all</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--all</code> adds all (both of) the unstaged files, so you don't have to type them one by one. (You might often see an alternative syntax which uses a dot to specify &quot;all&quot;: <code>git add .</code>. Either way is fine; they mean the exact same thing.)</p>
<p>If you check your status again now, you should see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git status
On branch studio0
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

        modified:   index.html
        modified:   js/flicklist.js</code></pre>
<p>Both files are now staged for committing. Go ahead and make a commit, using the -m flag to remind your future self (and others looking at your code) what changes you made during this commit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git commit -m "finish FlickList 0 studio"
[studio0 46db232] finish FlickList 0 studio
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)</code></pre>
<p>The convention is to write your commit messages using the present tense rather than past tense (e.g. &quot;finish&quot; rather than &quot;finished&quot;).</p>
<p>If you check your status one more time, you should see this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git status
On branch studio0
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
<p>Finally, <em>push</em> your changes to your remote repo:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git push origin studio0
