                    <h1 id="studio-mario-1">Studio: Mario 1</h1>
<p>For today's studio, and a few more to follow, we will do a Javascript version of the classic &quot;Mario&quot; problem, borrowed from our friends at CS50.</p>
<p>Before we get started, please enjoy this humorous meme about Mario:</p>
<p><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8e/57/97/8e57973c609cf14479731598acb76a89.jpg" alt="Oh Mario you are so silly" /></p>
<p>Turtles and such, simply uproarious, gets me every time.</p>
<p>Now then.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-the-starter-code">Obtaining the Starter Code</h2>
<p>In this Unit, you will use Git to work on exercises and check out the starter code for those exercises. This page will provide a detailed walkthrough of the steps involved in that process for today's studio.</p>
<p>Here is how to grab the starter code:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the parent directory where you want to keep your work for this class. For example, maybe something like <code>~/Documents/launchcode/front-end/</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone the Git repository that contains the starter code for this studio:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git clone https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/mario-js.git
Cloning into 'marios-js'...
remote: Counting objects: 103, done.

Resolving deltas: 100% (37/37), done.

<p>You should now have a folder called <code>mario-js</code> in your current directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate into your new <code>mario-js</code> folder, and see what's inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ cd mario-js
$ ls
mario.html      mario.js</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<h2 id="take-a-look">Take a Look</h2>
<p>Let's now see what this project looks like so far. Open up your <code>mario.html</code> file in a Chrome browser window.</p>
<p>You should see a very boring-looking page. The text on the page will invite you to open up the Chrome Developer Tools to see a &quot;beautiful pyramid&quot;:</p>
<p><img src="./images/mario-page.png" alt="Mario Page" /></p>
<p>Go ahead and open up the dev tools, and navigate to the Console tab. You should now see a print statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uh oh... the pyramid is under construction.
Check back soon, our developers are hard at work as we speak!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out, the &quot;developers&quot; are YOU. And indeed, you are about to be hard at work.</p>
<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>
<p>Let's take a look at the code. Open up <code>mario.js</code> in your text editor or IDE.</p>
<p>The file looks, essentially, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">printPyramid(5);

function printPyramid(height) {
    // TODO
}</code></pre>
<p>The first line invokes a function called <code>printPyramid</code>, passing in the number <code>5</code> as an argument.</p>
<p>In the function definition, we can see that the <code>5</code> we passed in represents the height of the pyramid. The <code>printPyramid</code> function is supposed to render to the console a &quot;pyramid&quot; (whatever that means) of the specified height.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. The body of the function is essentially blank, with a big fat <code>TODO</code> waiting for you.</p>
<p>Over in the <code>mario.html</code>, you will see the elements that make up our very simply HTML page. Notice the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag whose <code>src</code> attribute is equal to the path to our <code>mario.js</code> file: this is what causes the javascript code to execute every time the user visits or refreshes the page.</p>
<h2 id="your-task">Your Task</h2>
<p>What is this mysterious pyramid? Courtesy of CS50:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend a &quot;half-pyramid&quot; of blocks before leaping (if he wants to maximize his score) toward a flag pole. Below is a screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="http://d2o9nyf4hwsci4.cloudfront.net/2013/fall/psets/1/pset1/pyramid.png" alt="Mario Pyramid" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your job is to implement the <code>printPyramid</code> function, using <code>console.log</code> statements to print a half-pyramid, like the one above, to the console. You can use a <code>"#"</code> symbol for each &quot;brick&quot;.</p>
<p>The height of your pyramid should match the <code>height</code> argument that was passed in to the function. The pyramid in the image above has a height of 8. A pyramid of height 5 would result in a console that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="./images/pyramid5.png" alt="Pyramid Height 5" /></p>
<h2 id="tips-and-notes">Tips and Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notice, of course, that the pyramid slopes up to the right, and that the top row of the pyramid should be 2-bricks wide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be aware that in Javascript, a <code>console.log</code> statement automatically adds a newline character to the end of your string, so the next statement will start on the next line. This means that for each row of your pyramid, you will need to print that row all at once, rather than one character at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>Once you get it working, try passing in a different <code>height</code> argument rather than <code>5</code>, and you should of course see a different-sized result.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="committing-your-changes">Committing Your Changes</h2>
<p>Once you have finished, make sure you &quot;save&quot; your changes. In Git-land, this is a two-step process, <code>add</code>, and then <code>commit</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Add</strong></p>
<p>Here we specify which files we want to commit (&quot;save&quot;). Today we only modified one file, <code>mario.js</code>.</p>
<p>You can confirm as much by checking your status:</p>
<pre><code class="language-noghighlight">$ git status
On branch mario1
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/mario1'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   mario.js

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</code></pre>
<p>The important line is this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">        modified:   mario.js</code></pre>
<p>Now go ahead and <code>add</code> the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git add mario.js</code></pre>
<p>After adding, it, if you check your <code>status</code> again, you will now see that your file is staged as a &quot;change to be committed&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git status
On branch mario1
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/mario1'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

        modified:   mario.js</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit</strong></p>
<p>Now you are ready to <code>commit</code> the changes you have added.</p>
<p>When committing, you must also include a descriptive message of what you have changed. You can specify the message by including a <code>-m</code> flag, followed by the message in qutotation marks. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">$ git commit -m "implemented the printPyramid function"</code></pre>
<p>This descriptive message will allow other collaborators, and your future self, to easily see the history of the project.</p>
<p>After committing, if you check your status one more time, you will see that you are now in a &quot;clean&quot; state:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">On branch mario1
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/mario1' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
<p>For these studios, the important part is the last line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight">nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
<p>The other part is explaining that we are now one commit &quot;ahead of&quot; the remote repository on Github. But for these studios, we don't really care about staying in sync with the remote repo. To be clear, <strong>you do not need to use <code>git push</code></strong>. You can ignore the terminal's suggestion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! Congrats on finishing your first Javascript studio!</p>
<p>*NB, the reason the commit process is broken into two steps is because sometimes you might have modified multiple files, and you might not want to register all the changes as one big commit. You may want to break it up into multiple commits, with a reasonable message for each change. So the <code>add</code> command gives you the opportunity to specify exactly which files your want to include in a specific commit.</p>
