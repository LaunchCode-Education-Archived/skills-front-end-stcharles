# Class 6

Before coming to class today please complete [Class 6 Prep](../class6-prep).

### During Class

Today is mostly just a set-up day. We will do a walkthrough demo of the entire Studio from start to finish. The Studio will involve using Git on the command-line to checkout the starter code, and then registering for a key with the API we'll be using.

* Studio: [FlickList 0](../../materials/studios/flicklist0)

### Homework

* [Prep for Class 7](../class7-prep)
