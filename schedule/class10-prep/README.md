# Class 10 Prep

Before coming to Class 10, please complete the following tasks:

### Studio Recap
Task | Resource Type | Link | Time Estimate | Instructions
-----|---------------|------|---------------|-------------
Follow Along | Exercise | 30 minutes | [FlickList 3 Solution](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/flicklist/tree/studio3-staff-solution) | Read over (and maybe even code along with) the staff solution to the previous Studio, so that you're up to speed with the starter code for the upcoming one.


### HTTP, Callbacks and Promises
Task | Resource Type | Link | Time Estimate | Instructions
-----|---------------|------|---------------|-------------
Read | Interactive Book | [EloquentJS 17: HTTP][eloquent-17] | 4 hours | Revisit your old friend, Eloquent Javascript. This chapter begins by talking about the historical evolution of the relationship between Javascript and HTTP. He then goes on to discuss how AJAX requests with callbacks can start to get very hairy when you want to chain multiple requests together, one after the next. We will see run into this "callback hell" in the upcoming studio... get excited! He also briefly introduces a newish technology called Promises, which seems like a very promising (pun intended) way of overcoming this complexity. We won't go into Promises in this course, but it is something useful to be aware of and possibly learn more on your own later.
