                    <h1 id="skill-track-front-end-web">Skill Track: Front-end Web</h1>
<p>Welcome! This skill-track is an introduction to front-end web development.</p>
<h3 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h3>
<p>The term <em>front-end</em> (at least in the context of a web application) refers to the portion of a project that runs in the browser <strong>on the user's computer</strong>, as opposed to the <em>back-end</em> code which runs on a server computer somewhere else.</p>
<p>Specifically, you will write front-end code in a language called Javascript. Your Javascript code, because it runs on the user's computer, can be utilized to create a rich, interactive user experience by dynamically modifying and reacting to the HTML and CSS that make up your web page.</p>
<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>
<p>In addition to Javascript, we will also spend some more time on few other things, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>an extremely popular Javascript library called jQuery</li>
<li>writing nice, readable, &quot;semantic&quot; HTML code</li>
<li>using Git for version control</li>
<li>using CSS (and a CSS framework called Bootstrap) to create pages that actually look nice!</li>
<li>using a tool called Firebase that provides basic back-end services like user accounts, login and simple data storage for you, so you can go and make a project and specialize on the the front-end without having to worry about implementing the back-end yourself (even though you totally could by now...)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="structure-of-the-schedule">Structure of the Schedule</h3>
<p>The course will loosely be split into two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Learning Javascript.</strong> First, we will spend 2-3 weeks going over the fundamentals of Javascript, both its syntax and how to use it to interact with your page's HTML and CSS. During this time, your prep-work will consist of reading from an e-book and taking a few short online classes. The in-class studio exercises will be small and self-contained.</li>
<li><strong>Building a Class Project Together.</strong> Once you have learned the basics, we will start spending in-class studio time to build a class project together. Just like with the FlickList project from Unit 2, each studio assignment will involve adding a little bit more onto the project. In fact, we are going to build <em>FlickList</em> again! (Exciting, I know.) This version will be <a href="http://education.launchcode.org/flicklist">somewhat different</a> than the Unit 2 version, and of course we will focus on the front-end rather than the back-end. During this time, your prep-work will consist of just a few miscellaneous new concepts, but mostly you will be solidifying and getting more repetition and practice with the core concepts from part 1.</li>
</ol>
